*** 1-_What_Well_Build ***
we will build a tiny versoin of Rawg Site
https://rawg.io/

when we build project or feature(method)
first: Make it Work
second: Refactor the code 
third: Improve the code


*** 3-_Setting_Up_the_Project
we create React Project
npm create vite@4.1.0

we call the project: game-hub
we use TS then inside this project file we install all the dependencies
then run our project with npm run dev


- we connect our project to gitHub
1- initialize our project to  git repository
git init 
2- to add all the changes in our dirctory to staging 
git add .
to add our 
3- we commit our changes 
git commit -m "Initial commit"

4- we go to GitHub to create that repository (check the instruction of gitHub)

here we commit our code "create game-hub App"
*** 4-_Installing_Chakra_UI ***
there is too many libraries for styling UI (bootstrap, tailwind, chakraUI)
for this project we will use ChakraUI

https://v2.chakra-ui.com/

PS: 
1- to install it we press go started and chose the installion for Vite
2- we will not do the optional things right now ex: Customizing theme (Optional)
***********************************
when we add 
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

it`s better to orginze our import statment code 
ex: 
- import the React libraries first 
- import the third libraries
- import the local files 
***********************************

now after read the installion
we check if ChakraUI is installed by adding a button 

after remove everything in the App.tsx
we add button (method: ChakraUI site)

we see u ugly blue border around the button when we hover
coz we havn`t remove the the code from the index.css (so we remove all the style the code inside it to fix that)

until this point we check the git tree of of our chnages (always make sure to do that before commit to avoid commit unnecessary code )
and we commnt our code  "install ChakraUI" 

to check our commit until this point we type
git log --oneline 

PS:to check the first three commit only 
git log --oneline -n 3 


5-_Creating_a_Responsive_Layout
we want to add navbar to the top and side panal to the left and the main area in the middle

to do that we are going to use Grid component:
first we remove the everything from the App component coz we don`t need it any more

we use Grid component from the ChakraUI

<Grid templateAreas={``}></Grid>

PS: we used `` coz inside it we will add double string quotationã€€
ex: `"" ""`

now we want Nav on the top and side menu on the the left and main area
like this 
*********
<Grid
        templateAreas={`"nav nav" 
                        "aside main"`}
      ></Grid>
*********

now inside the Grid component we create GridItem and give an area from our four areas ()
<GridItem area={"nav"} bg={"coral"}>
          Nav
</GridItem>

and give it a bg (backgroud) color to see it

we duplicate this component  with 3 times Nav  Aside with our four areas

*********
 <Grid templateAreas={`"nav nav" "aside main"`}>
  <GridItem area={"nav"} bg={"coral"}>
    Nav
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem area={"aside"} bg={"gold"}>
    Aside
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem area={"main"} bg={"dodgerblue"}>
    Main
  </GridItem>
</Grid>
*********

now on the mobile devices we want to hide the aside panal to do that 
in the 
*********
templateAreas={`"nav nav" "aside main"`}
*********

we change string of templateAreas to object and inside it we can define the template area for each screen size
PS: for better understaing visit Chakra UI then access to "Styled System" then click on "Responsive Styles" we can check the break points
https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/responsive-styles

in our Project we will design our UI for two sizes normal and mobile
*********
templateAreas={{
          base: `"nav" "main"`,
          lg: `"nav nav" "aside main"`,
        }}
*********

we check our layout on the Devtool 
we see the aside template still there coz we still render it on the screen 

to make sure that Aside GridItem only render on the base tamplate
we should wrap it with Show component and give a property of "above"
*********
<Show above="lg">
  <GridItem area={"aside"} bg={"gold"}>
    Aside
  </GridItem>
</Show>
*********

here we commit our code 
"Build a responsive layout"
