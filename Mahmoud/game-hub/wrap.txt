*** 1-_What_Well_Build ***
we will build a tiny versoin of Rawg Site
https://rawg.io/

when we build project or feature(method)
first: Make it Work
second: Refactor the code 
third: Improve the code


*** 3-_Setting_Up_the_Project
we create React Project
npm create vite@4.1.0

we call the project: game-hub
we use TS then inside this project file we install all the dependencies
then run our project with npm run dev


- we connect our project to gitHub
1- initialize our project to  git repository
git init 
2- to add all the changes in our dirctory to staging 
git add .
to add our 
3- we commit our changes 
git commit -m "Initial commit"

4- we go to GitHub to create that repository (check the instruction of gitHub)

here we commit our code "create game-hub App"
*** 4-_Installing_Chakra_UI ***
there is too many libraries for styling UI (bootstrap, tailwind, chakraUI)
for this project we will use ChakraUI

https://v2.chakra-ui.com/

PS: 
1- to install it we press go started and chose the installion for Vite
2- we will not do the optional things right now ex: Customizing theme (Optional)
***********************************
when we add 
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

it`s better to orginze our import statment code 
ex: 
- import the React libraries first 
- import the third libraries
- import the local files 
***********************************

now after read the installion
we check if ChakraUI is installed by adding a button 

after remove everything in the App.tsx
we add button (method: ChakraUI site)

we see u ugly blue border around the button when we hover
coz we havn`t remove the the code from the index.css (so we remove all the style the code inside it to fix that)

until this point we check the git tree of of our chnages (always make sure to do that before commit to avoid commit unnecessary code )
and we commnt our code  "install ChakraUI" 

to check our commit until this point we type
git log --oneline 

PS:to check the first three commit only 
git log --oneline -n 3
