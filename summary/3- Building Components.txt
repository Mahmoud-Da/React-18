Building Components

Terms
- Fragment 
- Immutable 
- Props 
- State 
- hook

Summary

- In React apps, a component can only return a single element. To return multiple elements,
 we wrap them in a fragment, which is represented by empty angle brackets.

- To render a list in JSX, we use the ‘array.map()’ method. When mapping items,
 each item must have a unique key, which can be a string or a number.

- To conditionally render content, we can use an ‘if’ statement or a ternary operator.

- We use the state hook to define state (data that can change over time) in a component.
 A hook is a function that allows us to tap into built-in features in React.

- Components can optionally have props (short for properties) to accept input.

- We can pass data and functions to a component using props.
 Functions are used to notify the parent (consumer) of a component about certain events that occur in the component,
  such as an item being clicked or selected.

- We should treat props as immutable (read-only) and not modify them.

- When the state or props of a component change,
 React will re-render the component and update the DOM accordingly.

Difference between the Props and State
- Props
1- input passed to a component
2- Similar to function args 
3- Immutable (unchangeble: read only which means we can change them)
4- cause a re-render


State
1- Data managed by a component
2- Similar to local variables
3- mutable (changeble)
4- cause a re-render

Commens:
(4) when Props and state changes React will render the component
 and update the DOM accordingly.
