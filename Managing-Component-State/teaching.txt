****State Hook****
1- React updates the state asynchronously(not immediately)
coz: 
Performance reasons (every time we handle event if we set too much variables the Performance will be slow)
so after the handle finish the execution it patch all the change togather
example: 
ButtonShow1 component (ex1)

2- State is stored outside of components
example: 
ButtonShow1 component (ex2)

when we difined our count variable it`s scope inside the ButtonShow function
which means when function(component) finish the it excution the count local variable will removed from memory
that`s means next time we call the component count variable will reset to 0 and the updated that we made count++ will lost
that`s why we use useState to store the varible outside the component


3- only use hooks at the top level of our component
example: 
ButtonShow1 component (ex3)
when we stored our too hooks values [first hook value, second hook value] and map it to the local hooks variables inside the function
the React stored them in order
thats why we can not use hooks in if statemnet or for loops (impact the order if stored hooks values)


****choosing the state structure****
example: 
FullName component
- Aviod redundant state variables (like const fullName somthing can created from existed varible) {ex1}

- when we have multible variables related
Group related variables inisde and object
{ex2}

-when using objects
Aviod deeply nested structure (coz hard to update)
{ex2}


****Keeping Pure****
in computer Saince:
Pure Function:  (opposite inPure)
Given the same input, always returns the same result
which means:
if we called a function 10 times it should the same result

in React:
Props  --->     Componet    ---> JSX
if we give the same props it shuold give the same jsx

so if the props not change the component can skip reRendrenig and make our Performance fast

to keep our component Pure
- keep changes out of the render phase
